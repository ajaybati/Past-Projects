# Past-Projects
I have mainly been working on an investing project by analyzing stocks of several companies along with their price, price change, debt to equity ratio, and several other features from 2003-2013 and comparing it to the SP500 index. Using sklearn, I want to see whether I can predict if a company is a buy, sell, or keep (investing.py)

Additionally, I tried challenging myself recreate a mini-game from my childhood within 3 hours; I did this in one sitting and created a partial version of Snake (snake.py)

Recently I started using the data in a kaggle competition meant to predict the number of fatalities and occurrences of SARS-COVID-19 throughout the world given data from January 2020 to April beginning 2020 (kaggleCOVID.py)

Besides these projects, I have worked with a lot of data and storing them in SQL tables, but most of my work was done in the UCSC Alexa Prize Team (private repo).
