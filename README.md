# Past-Projects
I have mainly been working on an investing project by analyzing stocks of several companies along with their price, price change, debt to equity ratio, and several other 
features from 2003-2013 and comparing it to the SP500 index. Using sklearn, I want to see whether I can predict if a company is a buy, sell, or keep.

Additionally, I tried challenging myself recreate a mini-game from my childhood within 3 hours; I did this in one sitting and created a partial version of Snake.

Besides these two mini-projects, I have worked with a lot of data and storing them in SQL tables, but most of my work was done in the UCSC Alexa Prize Team (private repo).
