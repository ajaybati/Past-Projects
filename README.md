# Past-Projects

These are some of the projects I had been working on in the past. Most of these are small bits of code that are written for the UCSC Alexa Prize Team for testing. Unfortunately, I cannot post the code I had written there onto here since it is a huge file and not personally mine, but some of the scraping and API testing is available.

To run the code, make sure to have python3 and all the libraries, packages, and modules as listed on the top of each code.
